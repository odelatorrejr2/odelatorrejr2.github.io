### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs; although this lab didn't have very much coding or that many complex tasks, I still found this lab as one of my favorites. The reason is that this lab asked us to print out the word "hello world" using std::cout as this was one of the first basic objects we learned in our CPSC 120 class. However, this was the first time I had ever written a line of code, and it was a very monumental moment.

* Lab 4
    
    Another lab that was one of my favorites was Lab 4, part 2. I liked this part of the lab because we created our first programmed game, just a number-guessing game that gave you hints if you guessed higher or lower. This lab allowed us to review and learn more about "if" statements while going through a series of trial and errors. In addition, building this game was fun as I felt like an actual video game engineer.

* Lab 7 
    
    The last lab I enjoyed was lab 7, part 1 because this lab was expanding on lab 4, part 2. It was the same high and low number guessing game but with adding more elements to the game, like having two players, making the secret number more discrete, and adding more turns for the player while still giving them hints. Up to this point of the lab we learned a lot about loops, if statements and command line arguments to build and write different sets of functions to create this program, which required a lot of problem solving. Although a little more challenging this lab was, it was astonishing to see our accomplishments in the end.
